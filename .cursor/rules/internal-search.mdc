# AppEng_Search MCP Server
A MCP server for searching internal firm specific information. This MCP server could answer question about our internal
documentation, systems, guides, policies and prior Slack conversations.

## Tools exposed by this MCP server

### search_docs

Get search results for a specific query via the internal search API for DESCO (our firm name).
This works in association with the `search_get_content` tool to get more context about the document using the id of the document.
The search api works to get content from different sources:
- Confluence : Contains documentation, meeting notes, etc.
- Slack : Contains messages, threads related to the conversation users have had for a problem or question.
- Panopto : Contains videos around firmwide tools/services and training sessions.
- Circuit : Contains informational blogs, annnouncements. It works as a intranet for the firm.
- Github Documentation : Contains documentation for the different repositories in the firm's github.

Use when: “Where is the doc for X?”, “How to configure Y?”, “Internal policy for Z?”
Call: `search_docs({ "query": "<user question>", "top": 8 })`

### search_get_content
Retrieve full content for a specific document by ID via the internal DESCO Search API.

Use after `search_docs` when you have an `id`.
Call: `search_get_content({ "id": "<top_result_id>" })`

#### summarize_content

Use for “summarize/overview/survey” style asks.
Call: `summarize_content({ "query": "<topic or question>" })`


## What to do (in this order)
1) **Use the internal search first**
   - Call `search_docs` with the user’s query (verbatim or lightly clarified), `top=8–10`.

2) **If results are returned**
   - Pick the best 3-4 hits by title/highlight.
   - For any selected hit that you consider to have the right context, call `search_get_content` with the returned `id` to fetch full content/context.
   - Synthesize a concise answer that cites titles + sources from the results (include the `source`/`webUrl` if provided).

3) **If search returns nothing useful**
   - Say you found no good internal matches, then get clarification from the user to gather more context.

4) **Summarization requests**
   - If the user asks to “summarize/survey/overview” a topic, call `summarize_content` with the natural-language query.
   - Return the summary plus top items; include any disclaimers the tool provides.

## Style & safety
- Keep answers source-grounded; quote minimally and attribute clearly.
- Never paste raw secrets, tokens, or internal URLs unless the user explicitly needs them for the task.
